# Minesweeper 😏  💣 

## Background 
This game is an all time classic, as a 90's kid I remember the countless hours\
I spent playing it back when windows 95 was a thing..

## ⚡ Intro
As part of OOP course that I've taken in my 2nd year of college me and my partner\
were asked to create our own version of the game using Java as the logic and JavaFX\
as the GUI.\
This was the result :)



## 🛠 The program 
So the logic again is in Java while the Gui was written in JavaFX.\
We of course kept the rules as there are and just added some twists of our own.
You are more than welcome to give it a go!
